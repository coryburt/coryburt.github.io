<h2 class="blog-post-title">The Fable of the Gullible Gulls -- Revisited</h2>

<p class="blog-post-meta">by <a href="/docs/Cory_Burt_Resume_Current.pdf">Cory</a></p>

	<p>In the Reader’s Digest magazine, the October, 1950 issue, one will find a very brief story entitled, “The Fable of the Gullible Gulls.”&nbsp;
        This article describes flocks of seagulls near St. Augustine, Florida, that were seen to be starving.&nbsp;
        The explanation given was that these gulls had learned to eat from the nets of shrimping boats, but had "forgotten" how to feed themselves in the "natural" way.&nbsp;
        It was asserted that the gulls had run afoul of an utterly depraved sense of entitlement, (no pun intended), and had become completely dependent on the shrimp fleet.&nbsp;
        Then, when the fleet “moved on,” it left the hapless and over-fed birds high and dry.&nbsp;
        It was further asserted that they had never taught their offspring to fish, so they, too, were left helpless and starving.</p>

	<p>Why, I’m sure you’re wondering, would I devote a blog entry to this odd story from an issue of Reader’s Digest that is 67 years old, (as of the month of this entry).&nbsp;
        Well, it turns out this little anecdote &ndash; which is really nothing more than a Cold-war anti-Communist trope &ndash; has managed to strike a chord that keeps reverberating through the years.&nbsp;
        It has been oft-repeated and has become the basis for numerous variations ever since.  It has even become the inspiration for misogynistic and paranoid scare-stories; but it is usually rolled out as a Just-So-Story about the follies of socialism and the horrors of the dole.&nbsp;
        These retellings are always followed by lurid warnings about Communist conspiracies, socialist decay, and the sad plight of lay-abouts on welfare; or, it is linked to platitudes about the Protestant Work Ethic and a stern reminder that the world doesn’t owe you a living.</p>

	<p>This fable's popular interpretation has become something of a meme, and is never thought of as anything other than a clear warning about the dangers of the welfare state.&nbsp;
        Our culture seems emotionally “attached” to this interpretation and the presumptive moral to the story; perhaps because it just feels so obvious and right-headed.  However, I’m writing about it now because this fable has always left me with an uneasy feeling.&nbsp;
        Like most people, I’ve heard it repeated now and again, and nodded my head in blank agreement with the moral interpretations tacked on.</p>

    <p>However, I could never shake the nagging sensation that fishy propaganda was lurking here.&nbsp; So, I "hit the reset button," and considered some hard questions.</p>

	<p>The first and most obvious question is, how much of this allegory about gullible gulls is actually true?&nbsp;
        Was this a mass die-off that made the papers in St. Augustine sometime around 1950?&nbsp;
        Did the federal Fish and Wildlife Service investigate?&nbsp;
        I couldn’t find any corroborating news items in my own (admittedly cursory) searches, but that doesn’t prove anything.&nbsp;
        In truth, fully fifty-percent of the seagulls in the northern Pacific coast have died off, as of about 2012, and no one has raised more that peep about it.&nbsp;
        So, I wouldn’t expect it to be front-page news in Cold War-obsessed 1950.</p>

	<p>The next, and perhaps more pointed question is, did this involve a particularly stupid breed of seagull?&nbsp;
        It is true that gulls do appear to teach their young chicks various behaviors such as gathering food &ndash; and this is rightly interpreted as a sign of significant intelligence &ndash; but did this mean they left starving chicks on the beach to wither away and die?&nbsp;
		The feeding habits of seagulls show, if nothing else, an incredible degree of adaptability and a resourcefulness normally associated with notable intelligence.&nbsp;
        When the fishing is bad, they simply find a landfill or garbage heap to raid.&nbsp;
        If an area becomes inhospitiable, they move on, (as, <em>apparently,</em> the fishing fleet did).&nbsp;
        With long narrow wings, they are &ndash; like most sea-birds &ndash; spectacular flyers, have the remarkable ability to drink seawater without being poisoned by the salt content, and are known to travel amazingly long distances.&nbsp;
        Did all the “free shrimp” <em>really</em> render them dim-witted and flightless?&nbsp;
        The truth is, the seagull is a veritable poster child for adaptability and hardy survival instincts.&nbsp;
		The exact opposite, <em>by the way,</em> of a stereotypical welfare slob.</p>

	<p>The obvious corrollary question is how – in the space of one or two generations – was millions of years of instinctual behavior and virulent self-preservation so abruptly and effectively erased?&nbsp;
        Only a conscious choice to surrender to shiftless indolence could explain it.&nbsp;
        Gulls are surprisingly smart birds – but they can’t possibly be <em>that</em> smart, (or that easily corrupted).&nbsp;
        It simply makes no sense that hunger unto starvation wasn’t enough to jolt them out of some “welfare state of mind” and into self-preservation mode.</p>

	<p>The next question is how did the seagulls really view their situation.&nbsp;
        Did they understand that the shrimping boats weren’t a natural phenomenon, or did they see it as just a place where it was mysteriously easy to get a lot of shrimp?&nbsp;
        More to the point, did they know they were on welfare?&nbsp;
        The question answers itself when you put it that way: <em>of course they didn’t know it!</em>&nbsp;
        To them, it was just a very fertile scavanging place; they were doing exactly what their natural inclinations led them to do: take advantage of what “nature” was offering.&nbsp;
        When the pickings grew thin, they would do what they always did when that happened: quickly wing it to some other location.&nbsp;
        If this weren’t the natural reaction, there would be mass die-offs of seagulls happening with frightening regularity.&nbsp;
        (Such die-offs are, in fact, happening, but it has nothing to do with profligate fishermen or the evils of the dole).</p>

	<p>And what about this business of the fishing fleet “moving on?”&nbsp;
        If it had moved to other fishing grounds, why wouldn’t the gulls have simply followed it there?&nbsp;
        The most obvious explanation for the disappearence of the shrimping fleet is that it was suffering the consequences of its own poor conservation practices.&nbsp;
        Whether they “moved on” or abandoned the business, it is likely that overfishing left it unprofitable.&nbsp;
        If that had occurred, they may have damaged the entire ecosystem of the area.&nbsp;
        And, if <em>that</em> had occurred, it would certainly explain a lot of starvation among the gulls.&nbsp;
        It would have been even worse for less hardy species.</p>

	<p>The question that is really drawn out by the over-cooked interpretation of the story is this: what &ndash; really &ndash; is the dreaded “welfare state,” and does it have the magical power to sully the character of anyone, (even a bird), who lives under its “poisonous” influence?&nbsp;
        I am certainly not suggesting that thrift and self-reliance are not preferrable to sloth and a sense of entitlement; and it may well be true that the dole can have a degrading and corrupting influence on human beings who already lack moral backbone.&nbsp;
        But, to insist that <em>all</em> humans would succumb is absurd; then, to impute such a flaw to a non-human species is just mean-spirited.</p>

	<p>Once honestly questioned, it turns out that the “Socialist Interpretation” of seagull behavior in this fable is just too silly to be taken seriously &ndash; no matter how much of the underlying story is actually true.&nbsp;
        Ironically, it is, more accurately, a tragic story of the evils of greed and the follies of overexploitation and overconsumption &ndash; which are things that are not inherent to socialism but rather to unfettered capitalism; and how such things can devastate even the most resilient species… &nbsp;
        Including us.</p>
