title:              "The Fable of The Gullible Gulls -- Revisited"
---


In the October, 1950, Reader's Digest magazine, one will find a very brief story entitled, "The Fable of the Gullible Gulls."&nbsp; 
This article describes flocks of seagulls near St. Augustine, Florida, that were seen to be starving.&nbsp; 
The explanation given was that these gulls had learned to eat from the nets of shrimping boats, then -- mysteriously -- lost the ability to feed themselves in the "expected" way.&nbsp; 
These gulls, as the explanation goes, had run afoul of an utterly depraved sense of entitlement, (no pun intended), 
and had become completely dependent on the shrimp fleet for all their food.&nbsp;
Then -- with no explanation offered -- the fleet just "moved on," leaving the hapless and over-fed birds high and dry.&nbsp; 
It is further asserted that they had never taught their offspring to fish, so they, too, were left helpless and starving.

Why, I'm sure you're wondering, would I devote a blog entry to an odd story from an issue of Reader's Digest that is, as of the month of this entry, 67 years old.&nbsp;
Well, it turns out this little anecdote -- which is really nothing more than a Cold-war anti-Communist 
trope -- has managed to strike a chord that keeps reverberating through the years.&nbsp; 
It has been oft-repeated and has become the basis for numerous variations ever since.&nbsp; 
It has even become the inspiration for misogynistic and paranoid scare-stories; 
but it is usually rolled out as a Just-So-Story about the follies of socialism and the horrors of the dole.&nbsp; 
These retellings are always followed by lurid warnings about Communist conspiracies, socialist decay, and the sad plight 
of lay-abouts on welfare; or, it is linked to platitudes about the Protestant Work Ethic and a stern reminder that 
the world doesn't owe you a living. 

This fable is never interpreted as anything other than a clear warning about the dangers of the welfare state; it is generally accepted without question.&nbsp; 
We are "attached" to this interpretation and the presumptive moral to the story because it just *feels* so obvious and right-headed.&nbsp; 
However, I'm writing about it now because this fable has always left me with an uneasy feeling.&nbsp;
Like most people, I've listened to it and nodded my head in blank agreement with the moral conclusions tacked on to the end.&nbsp; 
But, I could never shake the nagging sensation that untrustworthy propaganda is lurking below the surface.&nbsp;

So, I really started to think it through and ask a few hard questions.

The first and most obvious question: is this allegory about gullible gulls actually true?&nbsp; 
Was this a mass die-off that made the papers in St. Augustine sometime around 1950?&nbsp; 
Did the federal Fish and Wildlife Service investigate?&nbsp; 
I couldn't find any corroborating news items in my own (admittedly cursory) searches, but that doesn't prove anything.&nbsp; 
In truth, fully fifty-percent of the seagulls in the northern Pacific coast have died off, as of about 2012, and no one has raised more that peep about it.&nbsp; So, I wouldn't expect it to be front-page news in Cold War-obsessed 1950.

The next, and perhaps more pointed question is, did this involve a particularly stupid breed of seagull?&nbsp;
The feeding habits of seagulls show, if nothing else, an incredible adaptability and a resourcefulness normally associated with notable intelligence.&nbsp; 
When the fishing is bad, they simply find a landfill or garbage heap to raid.&nbsp; 
If an area becomes inhospitiable, they move on, (as the fishing fleet did).&nbsp; 
With long narrow wings, they are -- like most sea-birds -- spectacular flyers, and known to travel amazingly long distances.&nbsp; 
Did all the "free shrimp" suddenly render them dim-witted and flightless?&nbsp; 
The truth is, the seagull is a veritable poster child for adaptability and hardy survival instincts.&nbsp; 
The exact opposite of a stereotypical welfare slob.

The obvious corrollary question is how -- in the space of one or two generations -- was millions of years of instinctual behavior and 
virulent self-preservation so abruptly and effectively erased?&nbsp;
Only a conscious choice to surrender to shiftless indolence could explain it.&nbsp;
Gulls are surprisingly smart birds -- but they can't possibly be *that* smart, (or that easily corrupted).&nbsp; 
It simply makes no sense that hunger unto starvation wasn't enough to jolt them out of some "welfare state of mind" and into self-preservation mode.

The more questions I asked, the more the story's facade began to crumble off.

The next question is how did the seagulls *really* view their situation.&nbsp; 
Did they understand that the shrimping boats weren't a natural phenomenon, 
or did they see it as just a place where it was mysteriously easy to get a lot of shrimp?&nbsp; 
Specifically, did they *know* they were on welfare?&nbsp;
The question answers itself when you put it that way: of course they didn't know it.&nbsp;
To them, it was just a very fertile scavanging place; they were doing exactly what their natural inclinations led them to do: take advantage of what "nature" was offering.&nbsp; 
When the pickings grew thin, they would do what they always did when that happened: quickly wing it to some other location.&nbsp; 
If this weren't the natural reaction, there would be mass die-offs of seagulls happening with frightening regularity.&nbsp; (Such die-offs are, in fact, happening, but it has nothing to do with profligate fishermen or the evils of the dole).

And what about this business of the fishing fleet "moving on?"&nbsp; 
If it had moved to other fishing grounds, why wouldn't the gulls have simply followed it there?&nbsp; 
The most obvious explanation for the disappearence of the shrimping fleet is that it was suffering the consequences of its own poor conservation practices.&nbsp;
Whether they "moved on" or abandoned the business, it is likely that overfishing left it unprofitable.&nbsp;
If that had occurred, they may have damaged the entire ecosystem of the area.&nbsp; 
And, if *that* had occurred, it would certainly explain a lot of starvation among the gulls.&nbsp;
It would have been even worse for less hardy species.&nbsp;

The question that is really drawn out by the over-cooked interpretation of the story is this: what -- *really* -- is the dreaded "welfare state," and does it have the magical power to sully the character of anyone, (even a bird), who lives under its "poisonous" influence?&nbsp;
I am certainly not suggesting that thrift and self-reliance are not preferrable to sloth and a sense of entitlement; and it may well be true that the dole can have a degrading and corrupting influence on human beings who already lack moral backbone.&nbsp; But, to impute such an ugly character weakness to any non-human species is just mean-spirited.

Once honestly questioned, it turns out that the "Socialist Interpretation" of seagull behavior in this fable is just too far-fetched to be taken seriously -- no matter how much of the underlying story is actually true.&nbsp;
Ironically, it is, more accurately, a tragic story of the evils of greed, and how the follies of overexploitation and overconsumption -- things that 
are not inherent to socialism but rather to unfettered capitalism -- can devastate even the most resilient species... Including us.
