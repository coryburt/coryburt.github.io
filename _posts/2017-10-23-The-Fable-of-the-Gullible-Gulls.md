title:              "The Fable of The Gullible Gulls -- Revisited"
---


In the October, 1950, Reader's Digest magazine, one will find a snippet of an article entitled, "The Fable of the Gullible Gulls."&nbsp; 
This article describes flocks of seagulls near St. Augustine, Florida, that were seen to be starving.&nbsp; 
The explanation given was that these gulls had learned to eat from the nets of shrimping boats, then -- mysteriously -- lost the ability to feed themselves in the "expected" way.&nbsp; 
These gulls, as the explanation goes, had run afoul of an utterly depraved sense of entitlement, (no pun intended), 
and had become completely dependent on the shrimp fleet for all their food.&nbsp;
Then -- with no explanation offered -- the fleet just "moved on," leaving the hapless and over-fed birds high and dry.&nbsp; 
It is further asserted that they had never taught their offspring to fish, so they, too, were left helpless and starving.

This fable has been repeated and exploited a number of times, in various contexts, ever since it first appeared as a Cold War 
anti-communist trope.&nbsp; 
It has been used as a basis for misogynistic and racist allegories and blatant scare-stories; 
but it is usually rolled out as a Just-So-Story about the follies of socialism and the horrors of the dole.&nbsp; 
It is always followed either by gruesome warnings about Communist conspiracies and socialist decay, or platitudes about 
provident living, self-reliance, and the stern reminder that the world doesn't owe you a living. 

The interpretation of this fable as a clear warning to all about the dangers of the welfare state is widely accepted at face value.&nbsp; 
We are "attached" to this interpretation and the superficial moral to the story seems so obvious and right-headed.&nbsp; 
It is wonderfully attuned to the Protestant Work Ethic: hard work, thrift, and self-reliance are much more than just their own rewards.&nbsp; 

The trouble is, this fable has always left me with an uneasy feeling.&nbsp;
Like most people, I listened to it and nodded my head in blank agreement with the interpretation and the moral conclusions tacked on to
the end.&nbsp; But, I could never shake the nagging sensation that this story is untrustworthy propaganda.&nbsp;

So, I really started to think it through and ask a few hard questions.

The first and most obvious question is: is this allegory about gullible gulls actually true?&nbsp; 
Was this a mass die-off that made the papers in St. Augustine sometime around 1950?&nbsp; 
Did the federal Fish and Wildlife Service investigate?&nbsp; 
I couldn't find any such news in my own (admittedly cursory) searches, but that doesn't prove anything.&nbsp; 
In truth, fully fifty-percent of the seagulls in the northern Pacific coast have died off, as of about 2012, and no one has raised more that peep about it.&nbsp; So, I wouldn't expect it to be front-page news in Cold War-obsessed 1950.

The next, and perhaps more pointed question is, did this involve a particularly stupid breed of seagull?&nbsp;
The feeding habits of seagulls show, if nothing else, an incredible adaptability and a resourcefulness normally associated with notable intelligence.&nbsp; 
When the fishing is bad, they simply find a landfill or garbage heap to raid.&nbsp; 
If an area becomes inhospitiable, they move on, (as the fishing fleet did).&nbsp; 
With long narrow wings, they are -- like most sea-birds -- spectacular flyers, and known to travel amazingly long distances.&nbsp; 
Did all the "free shrimp" suddenly render them flightless?&nbsp; 
The truth is, the seagull is a veritable poster child for resourcefulness, ingenuity, and hardy survival instincts.&nbsp; 
The exact opposite of a stereotypical welfare slob.

The obvious corrollary question is how -- in the space of one or two generations -- was millions of years of instinct and adaptation 
in self-preservation so abruptly and effectively erased?&nbsp;
Only a conscious choice to surrender to shiftless indolence could explain it.&nbsp;
Gulls are surprisingly smart birds -- but they can't possibly be *that* smart.&nbsp; 
It simply makes no sense that hunger unto starvation wasn't enough to jolt them out of their "welfare state of mind" and into self-preservation mode.

The story's facade is beginning to crumble off.

The next question is how did the seagulls *really* view their situation.&nbsp; 
Did they understand that the shrimping boats weren't a natural phenomenon, 
or did they see it as just a place where it was mysteriously easy to get a lot of shrimp.&nbsp; 
Specifically, did they *know* they were on welfare?&nbsp;
The question answers itself when you put it that way: of course they didn't know it.&nbsp;
To them, it was just a very fertile scavanging place.&nbsp; 
And, when the pickings grew thin, they would do what they always did when the garbage or the fish were gone: 
they would quickly wing it to some other location.&nbsp; 
If this weren't the natural reaction, there would be mass die-offs of seagulls happening every other week.&nbsp;
We would know them to be the stupidest and most helpless creatures ever to take wing.&nbsp;
In fact, they would, almost certainly, be extinct by now.&nbsp;

And what about this fishing fleet "moving on?"&nbsp; 
If it had moved to other fishing grounds, why wouldn't the gulls have simply followed it there?&nbsp; 
To make a radical change of fishing grounds, the fleet would have go through the massive expense and trouble of relocating their home port.&nbsp; 
It is far more likely that, when the shrimp had been "fished-out," the shrimp boats were simply abandoned in place.&nbsp;
The most obvious explanation is that, whatever happened to the fleet, it was suffering the consequences of its own poor conservation.&nbsp;
Whether they "moved on" or went out of business, it is likely that severe overfishing the area left it unprofitable to continue.&nbsp;
If that had occurred, they would have likely damaged the entire ecosystem of the area.&nbsp; 
And, if *that* had occurred, it would certainly explain a lot of starvation among the gulls.&nbsp;
It would have been even worse for less hardy species.&nbsp;

The more you think about this fable, the less believable it becomes.&nbsp; 
If there is a strain of truth in the events it depicts, it is almost certain that the traditional "Socialism Explanation" assigned to the story is a convenient fiction that twists the essential truth.&nbsp; 
I am certainly not arguing that thrift and self-reliance are not far preferrable to sloth and a sense of entitlement.&nbsp;
But using this fable to make that point is so wrong that it stretches the bounds of irony.&nbsp;

The fable of the Gullible Gulls is *not* a moral tale about the follies of socialism and the evils of the dole at all.&nbsp;
It is, more accurately, a tragic story of the evils of greed, and how the follies of overexploitation and overconsumption -- things that 
are not inherent to socialism but rather to unfettered capitalism -- can devastate even the most resilient species... Including us.
