Creating a Github Pages site blog is all about more HTML, CSS, and Javascript than I have done in a while.&nbsp; I have, of late, thought of myself as 
a "systems developer" with an emphasis on Python3.&nbsp; I freely confess that my favorite programming language is always the one I've used the most 
in my most recent activities.&nbsp; Several years ago, that was Perl and then PHP.&nbsp; 
If you have a sadistic turn of mind and decide to inflict the dread whiteboard coding test on me, it still comes out as Perl.&nbsp; 
(I am usually effusive in erudite English, _impromptu_, in front of audiences of more than one; 
mysteriously, one-on-one interaction is where things begin to go south for me).&nbsp; 
As they like to say in the Perl community: TIMTOWTODI.&nbsp;

That is why I have been excited to find out about tools like [Skulpt](http://www.skulpt.org/), [PyPy.js](http://pypyjs.org/), [Transcrypt](http://transcrypt.org/),
and [RapydScript](https://bitbucket.org/pyjeon/rapydscript).&nbsp; 
These are among the most thoroughly developed, but there are others out there that do what they do, namely: implement Python2 or Python3 in the browser.&nbsp; 
They are Javascript libraries that integrate the Python language, in one way or another, with the Javascript engine that is already there.&nbsp; 
Of particular interest to me is the (admittedly massive) [Brython](http://brython.info/) library.

I can hear a gaggle of Javascript specialists out there asking, "Huh?"&nbsp; But, there might a few erstwhile Pythonistas replying, "Makes sense to me."

Try the [Brython console](http://brython.info/console.html) for yourself.&nbsp; 
You can experiment with it directly to discover how much of the full Python3 language is actually implemented.&nbsp; 
Quite a large number of Python libraries are available for import -- not all, of course, but support is growing.&nbsp; 
Best of all, it makes scripting the browser available to the Python programmer.&nbsp; 
If I've the time, I will give it a try and demonstrate some some experiments with it for myself.&nbsp; 
Perhaps using Javascript to replace Javascript with Python is not the most emminently practical thing to do, but is, by all reports, surprisingly capable and responsive.&nbsp; 
Definitely amazing.
