Good question: why am I here?

Better question: why would you look for me here?

Best question: why would you find me here?

Apparently, a "presence" in the strip-mall that lines the information superhighway has become _de rigueur_.&nbsp; 
Required, I find, even for the likes of me: someone who has worked as a programmer, analyst, and consultant on computers for more than half my life.&nbsp; 
That's a long time.&nbsp; Not because I am a computer prodigy who started hacking my way through grade school, mind you.&nbsp; (When I was in grade school, 
computers were judged by how many tons of air conditioning were required to keep them from going China Syndrome).

No, that would be more than half my life in adult years.&nbsp; The kind you start counting in earnest after you graduate from college.&nbsp; 
You'd think this presence might not be necessary in my case, but that would be a hasty assumption.&nbsp; Being my age doesn't mean being some kind 
of elder stateman whose gravitas sucks the oxygen out of the conference room.&nbsp; In a field of work and study that evolves at the speed of Moore's Law, 
you're never even quite as good as the last project you worked -- especially if that project "didn't work."&nbsp;
