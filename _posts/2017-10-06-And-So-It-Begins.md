Good question: why am I here?

Better question: why would you look for me here?

Best question: why would you find me here?

The answer is that I have discovered that a "presence" in the strip-mall that lines the information superhighway has simply become _de rigueur_.&nbsp; 
I have worked as a programmer, analyst, and consultant in "Information Technology" for more than half my life.&nbsp; 
That's a long time.&nbsp; Not because I am a computer prodigy who started hacking my way through grade school, mind you.&nbsp; (When I was in grade school, 
computers were judged by how many tons of air conditioning they required to keep from going [China Syndrome](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiJ_YGJ9t7WAhVBrlQKHedTAG0QFggmMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FThe_China_Syndrome&usg=AOvVaw224COq4UfYbpouV-jNrme-).&nbsp; 
No, that would be more than half my life in adult years.&nbsp; The kind you start counting in earnest _after_ you graduate from college.

My father -- were he still with us and savvy to the ways of the 21st century -- would think this presence should not be necessary.&nbsp; 
He would think a person of my age and experience would occupy something of an "elder stateman" status; one whose gravitas would suck the oxygen out 
of the conference room, and whose "experience" would be valued wherever it went.&nbsp; He would be wrong about that.

In a field of work and study that evolves at the speed of Moore's Law, one is never even quite as good as the last project one worked.&nbsp; 
This is a field where there the old "corporate ladder" is a historical footnote and an expression that fosters blank stares on the faces of most young workers.&nbsp; 
It used to be that only CEO's and COO's were valued by how many different organizations they have been part of.&nbsp; 
Now, staying too long in one place is viewed with hesitation, as if it meant not loyalty or job satisfaction, but lack of drive and ambition.&nbsp; 
This is a strange land where old experience is presumed to be obsolete experience.&nbsp; 
A place where the expression "soft skills" illicits the same blank stare that "corporate ladder" does.&nbsp;
It is a place where both the energy and the foibles of youth are job requirements.&nbsp; One doesn't "land a job" more than one is invited to "hang out."

So, here I am.&nbsp; 
Github is one of the choice virtual "Watering Holes" of my industry, and these awesome Github Pages represent a valuable resource, proffered in the true spirit of open-source.&nbsp; 
As I pound and piece my way through [Jekyll](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwj9uPXA-d7WAhVizlQKHbPNDAsQFggmMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fjekyllrb.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw2YD8MteLYGPeySP2jj4BHG) 
and brush off my Javascript and CSS, I will (probably) create Project Pages to go along with this personal blog.&nbsp; 
I don't expect to make many entries here -- though I am more stimulated by the sound of my own voice than I like to admit -- social media has always seemed to me 
to be the very definition of over-sharing.&nbsp; 
Thanks to my mother's philosophy that all men are Fat-heads, I can't make myself believe I'm interesting enough to indulge it.&nbsp; 
It is, nonetheless, the easiest and safest way for us to find out about one another -- even if it offers no path at all to the highest and innermost truths about us.&nbsp; 
Who wants to deal with that, anyway?
