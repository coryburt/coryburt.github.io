Good question: why am I here?

Better question: why would you look for me here?

Best question: why would you find me here?

Apparently, a "presence" in the strip-mall that lines the information superhighway has become _de rigueur_.&nbsp; 
Required, I find, even for the likes of me: someone who has worked as a programmer, analyst, and consultant on computers for more than half my life.&nbsp; 
That's a long time.&nbsp; (Not because I am a computer prodigy who started hacking my way through grade school, mind you; when I was in grade school, 
computers were judged by how many tons of air conditioning were required to keep them from going _China Syndrome_).&nbsp; No, that would be more than half my 
life in adult years.&nbsp; The kind you start counting in earnest after you graduate from college.

You'd think this presence might not be necessary in my case, but that would be a foolish assumption.&nbsp; Being my age doesn't mean being some kind 
of elder stateman whose gravitas sucks the oxygen out of the conference room.&nbsp; In a field of work and study that evolves at the speed of Moore's Law, 
you're never even quite as good as the last project you worked.&nbsp; This is field where there is no "corporate ladder" and old experience is always 
presumed to be obsolete experience.&nbsp; It's a place where "soft skills" carry little weight, (if the concept of "soft skills" is even understood), 
and youth is presumed superior in every way.&nbsp;
