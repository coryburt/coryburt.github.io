Why am I here?  Rather, why would you look for me here?  And find me.

Apparently, a "presence" in the strip-mall that lines the information superhighway has become _de rigeur_.  Required, at least, for the likes of me: someone who has worked as a programmer, analyst, and consultant on computers for more than half my life.
That's a long time.  You'd think it might not be necessary in my case, but that would be a rash assumption.
